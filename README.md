# PrimeOrNot
Checks if a fgiven integer input is prime or not

In the alternative.java file I added the following code:

if(number==1){
  ....
  }
  
if(number<1){
......
}

This called DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING. By declaring the some situations and my program's reaction to it, I make sure my code is working correctly without any collisions.
